# Hero System 6e Heroic
A Hero System 6th Edition character sheet for Roll20

This an alternate Hero System character sheet designed for use in heroic-level Hero System games such as Fantasy Hero or Star Hero. Characters in these games tend to have many skills, few powers, and employ weapons that generally do killing damage. The overall aim of this character sheet is to make playing Heroic-level games in Hero System as easy as possible. This sheet attempts to handle the basic bookkeeping math for characteristics, skills, powers, and complications. However, no skill names, power names, power descriptions, advantages, or limitations are included, except for the six skill enhancers, overall levels, and endurance-related choices, which are required for the internal math. Please refer to official Hero System rules publications or the official helper software Hero Designer for this information (https://www.herogames.com).

The number of skills (30 general, 7 combat, 6 maneuvers, and 9 languages) and powers (10) is hard-coded to handle the background math and for aesthetics, but should be sufficient for general use.

To keep the game on the simple side, this sheet is built for the combat that uses armor activation rolls rather than hit locations. There are input fields for the recording of armor locations, but otherwise the more advanced hit location rules are not supported at this time.

If you would like more flexibility in creating macros and have a Pro-level subscription you might consider adding Hero Roller https://wiki.roll20.net/Script:HeroRoller to your game API settings. This is an optional addition and is not necessary to play the game. 

## Buttons
Roll buttons are color-coded:

![Orange Button](/HeroSystem6eHeroic/images/OrangeButton.png) Orange buttons are for skill checks and characteristic rolls.

![Blue Button](/HeroSystem6eHeroic/images/BlueButton.png) Blue buttons are for armor activation rolls.

![Red Button](/HeroSystem6eHeroic/images/RedButton.png) Red buttons are for killing damage attacks.

![Green Button](/HeroSystem6eHeroic/images/GreenButton.png) Green buttons are for normal damage attacks.

![Purple Button](/HeroSystem6eHeroic/images/PurpleButton.png) Purple buttons are for powers.

## The Tally Bar

![Tally Bar](/HeroSystem6eHeroic/images/TallyBar.png)

At the bottom of the character sheet you will find the Tally Bar. The Total field represents points spent on characteristics, skills, and powers minus complications and bonus points. The latter represent free items in a campaign that shouldn't count against your starting point total, but nonetheless should be accounted for.

Note that the total points may not update immediately. You may force an update by clicking on any other item on the character sheet.

## Page 1: Characteristics

![Page 1](/HeroSystem6eHeroic/images/screenshot-01-scaled.png)

The first page displays characteristics, combat abilities, and movement abilities. Note that if your campaign does not use characteristic maximums (doubling points on abilities above these maximums) remember to uncheck this option on the Options Page.

The first page also includes a portrait section designed as a slideshow. The first shown is a "rule card" that is by default a welcome message. The second is the player's avatar image, which is currently a feature of the Dev Server, but should be available for general use soon. The third is a sticky note for text.

## Health Status Indicator

![Health Status Indicator](/HeroSystem6eHeroic/images/HealthStatus.png)

In the upper right corner of Page 1 and Page 2 is a health status indicator. The BODY field is an independent field and not linked to your character's maximum BODY value. The STUN and END fields are linked to your maximum STUN and Endurance. The Reset button will set these two status fields to your maximum values. The Recover button will add one recovery step to STUN and END, up to your characteristic values.

## Page 2: Gear

![Page 2](/HeroSystem6eHeroic/images/screenshot-02-scaled.png)

The Gear page provides space for most of a character's physical goods (weapons, armor, and equipment) as well as a list of common and marital combat maneuvers. Along the top is an accounting of your carried weight and DCV and movement penalties. The Endurance cost should be accounted for manually by deducting points from the character's health status at the end of each turn.

![Encumbrance](/HeroSystem6eHeroic/images/encumbrance.png)

The sheet includes space for four suits or pieces of armor. Although this sheet is currently written for the simpler armor activation system, there is a field for hit locations if your GM chooses to use that system. 

![Armor Table](/HeroSystem6eHeroic/images/armor.png)

Click the "Roll" button to roll armor activation. The message like the one shown below will be sent to the chat window. The shield line assumes attacking with a shield is a normal damage attack and that the DCV bonus for defense is an OCV penalty for attacks.

![Armor Activation Chat Message](/HeroSystem6eHeroic/images/BlueButtonChat.png)

The first four weapons have buttons for killing damage attacks. The fifth weapon slot can be used for a normal damage attack (e.g., a club or staff). In order to calculate the correct endurance expended, the STR field refers to the strength used, not the minimum strength required for the weapon.

![Weapons Table](/HeroSystem6eHeroic/images/weapons.png)

When a red killing attack roll button is pressed, a dialog box will first ask for combat bonuses or penalties, then a chat window will show the character's name, attack roll made and target, and the BODY and STUN damage rolls.

![Killing Attack Chat Message](/HeroSystem6eHeroic/images/RedButtonChat.png)

The fifth weapon's green roll button produces similar output, but assumes the weapon's damage dice are of type normal damage.

![Normal Attack Chat Message](/HeroSystem6eHeroic/images/GreenButtonChat.png)

The basic maneuvers list is contained in a slideshow so that it can be hidden by players familiar with these rules. A second pane allows for the addition of purchased martial maneuvers (shown below). A third pane can be used for notes and treasures.

![Martial Manuevers](/HeroSystem6eHeroic/images/martialManeuvers.png)

## Page 3: Skills

![Page 3](/HeroSystem6eHeroic/images/screenshot-03-scaled.png)

Characters in Heroic campaigns can have a lot of skills. On the left side of this page is room for 30 skills. The base skill chance is determined from the type of skill selected and the number of points spent. Skills 1, 5, 11, 15, 21, and 25 also include an additional skill type "Group" in their selection menus (indicated by ![Salmon Triangle](/HeroSystem6eHeroic/images/selectionGroup.png) instead of ![Olive Triangle](/HeroSystem6eHeroic/images/selectionStandard.png)). When this skill type is selected, every three points spent will apply a group level to the next three skills listed below the group skill. For example, in the image below, the first skill, "Spacecraft Officer," is a regular skill of type "PS" or "Professional Skill." The fifth skill, "Pilot Skill Group," is a group skill level that applies +1 to the skill rolls of Combat Pilot, Systems Operation, and Sensors Operation.

![Group Skill Levels](/HeroSystem6eHeroic/images/GroupSkillLevels.png)

There is space for up to nine languages. Any language skill selected with "Native" fluency costs 0 CP, except for those campaigns where literacy costs points (an option on the Options Page).

Skill Enhancers, when purchased (checked), reduce the cost of relevant knowledge-type skills. The benefit is reflected in the calculated skill rolls as per the number of points spent on each skill. The enhancer does not subtract character points. Note that the Skill Enhancer "Well-Connected" is not considered in the automatic calculation of any skill roll field. Keep this skill enhancer's benefit in mind when you calculate points spent on Perks on Page 5.

## Page 4: Powers

![Page 4](/HeroSystem6eHeroic/images/screenshot-04-scaled.png)

The Power page can accommodate ten powers. The left and right sides have different color schemes for organizational purposes, but are otherwise the same. Each power's points and endurance costs are calculated from the base cost provided and advantages and limitations entered. A power framework is treated as its own entry as shown in the figure below. The second power "Ice Bolts" belongs to the Multipower as a Variable Slot. The "AF" in "Reduced AF" refers to *autofire,* which is an advantage chosen for this particular power that increases the cost of Reduced Endurance.

![Multipower](/HeroSystem6eHeroic/images/Multipower.png)

The "Roll" button produces general output that may or may not apply to the power being used. When pressed, Roll20 will make a general 3d6 success roll, roll the dice provided as an effect (which may need to be translated as normal damage), displays the endurance cost, and shows the text box contents as a description. Note that the endurance cost shown is not automatically deducted from the character's health status. Some powers require multiple endurance costs (such as Autofire powers) or endurance every phase. Use the "END" button to deduct a power's endurance cost.

![Multipower](/HeroSystem6eHeroic/images/PurpleButtonChat.png)

## Page 5: Talents and Complications

![Page 5](/HeroSystem6eHeroic/images/screenshot-05-scaled.png)

The "Perks & Talents" column can be used for Talents, Perks, or any other item that doesn't fit elsewhere. Points spent in this section are counted as Powers in the Tally Bar. 

The only trick to the Complications column is to remember that points gained from selecting Complications *subtract* from the total points calculated in the Tally Bar. 

## Page 6: Options

![Page 6](/HeroSystem6eHeroic/images/screenshot-06-scaled.png)

The last page of this sheet contains a number of important options:

(1) Use Characteristic Maximums. If checked, character point costs are doubled above the standard Hero System maximums.

(2) Super-heroic Campaign Endurance. If checked, Strength costs 1 END per 5 STR to use rather than 1 END per 10 STR.

(3) Literacy Costs Character Points. If checked, literacy costs 1 CP per language selected in the Skills tab. Typical for Fantasy Hero settings but not Star Hero campaigns.

## Token Settings

![Token](/HeroSystem6eHeroic/images/SampleToken.png)

Roll20 tokens can display numeric values of three attributes as well as three status bars. Let me suggest the attributes *currentDCV,* *currentBODY,* and *currentEND* coupled with their maximum values as shown in the example settings dialog below. The hidden attribute *currentDCV* is presently equal to the character's DCV + Shield DCV Bonus - DCV Weight Penalty.
