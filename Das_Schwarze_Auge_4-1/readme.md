## Known Limitations
### Skill Checks: Double/Triple 1 or 20
Skill checks do not take double 1 (automatic success with max. result), double 20 (automatic failure) and triple 20 (disastrous failure) into account. This could either be implemented via API scripts (= available to paying accounts only) or via Custom Roll Parsing (new as of 2021-07-13, available to everyone).
